Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Finished character movement and physics for grappling hook mechanic, as well as a few sprites and backdrops are completed. I have begun building a full level.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Fully completed a level, possibly find or make a song to use, and create a menu. Also need to create the rest of my sprites I will use.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Big learning curve with my first time using Godot, as well as gdscript, which basically all other problems have stemmed from. Takes time but slowly figuring it all out.
